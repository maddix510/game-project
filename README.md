Night Harvest — a small browser game combining real-time strategy, survival-horror, and casual play.

Quick start

- Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.
- Open this workspace and press "Go Live" (or open `index.html` in a browser).

Controls

- Click `Deploy Drone` to spawn an autonomous unit that gathers scrap.
- Click `Build Light` to place a light near the base (reduces night danger).
- Drones auto-gather from glowing resource nodes and return scrap to the base.
- Survive through nights; enemies spawn at night and chase the base and units.

Development

- No build step. Files: `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`.
- To expand: modify `main.js` to add balancing, UI, or more mechanics.

I'll continue expanding this game each day based on your input.
